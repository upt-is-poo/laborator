### using 

The line `using System;` is a common statement in C# programming language. It is used to import the System namespace, which contains fundamental types and classes that are used in many C# programs.

In C#, namespaces are used to organize and group related classes and types. The System namespace, in particular, contains classes and types that are essential for basic functionality in C# programs. By including the `using System;` statement at the beginning of a C# file, you can access the classes and types within the System namespace without having to fully qualify their names.

For example, without the using System; statement, you would need to write `System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` to use the Console class from the System namespace. But with the using System; statement, you can simply write `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` because the Console class is now accessible without the need for the System prefix.

In summary, the `using System;` statement is used to import the System namespace in C# programs, allowing you to use its classes and types without fully qualifying their names.

### namespace

In C#, a namespace is a way to organize and group related code elements, such as classes, within a larger codebase. It helps to prevent naming conflicts and provides a logical structure to the code.

A namespace acts as a container that holds a collection of code elements. It allows you to define unique names for your code elements, even if they have the same name as code elements in other namespaces or libraries.

In the provided code snippet, `namespace SampleApp` indicates that the code elements within the SampleApp namespace belong to a specific group or module. This namespace can be used to encapsulate and organize the code related to a particular application or functionality.

For example, if you have multiple classes with the same name, you can differentiate them by placing them in different namespaces. This way, you can refer to each class using its fully qualified name, which includes the namespace.

Namespaces are commonly used in programming languages like C#, C++, and Java to organize code and avoid naming conflicts. They provide a way to create modular and maintainable codebase.

### class Program and Main

In C#, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a type that encapsulates data and behavior. The line `class Program` is a class declaration that introduces a new class named `Program`.

#### Key Points:
- **Keyword `class`**: This keyword is used to declare a class.
- **Class Name `Program`**: This is the name of the class. By convention, class names in C# are written in PascalCase.

#### Example:
```csharp
class Program
{
    // Class members go here
}
```

#### Usage:
- The `Program` class typically contains the `Main` method, which is the entry point of a C# console application.
- Inside the `Program` class, you can define fields, properties, methods, and other members that represent the data and behavior of the objects created from this class.

#### Example with `Main` Method:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Program` class contains a `Main` method, which is the starting point of the application. When the application runs, it executes the code inside the `Main` method, printing "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Console.WriteLine

The `Console.WriteLine` method is a built-in method in C# that is used to write a specified string followed by a new line to the standard output stream. It is commonly used to display messages or output data to the console.

The `Console.WriteLine` method can accept different types of arguments, including strings, numbers, and variables. It automatically converts the arguments to their string representation and then writes them to the console.

Here's an example usage of the `Console.WriteLine` method:

```csharp
int age = 25;
Console.WriteLine("Your age is: " + age);
```

In the above example, the `Console.WriteLine` method is used to display the value of the `age` variable to the console.

The `Console.WriteLine` method is a useful tool for debugging and providing feedback to the user during the execution of a program.

### Console.ReadLine

The `Console.ReadLine` method is a built-in method in C# that is used to read a line of text from the standard input stream. It allows the user to enter text in the console and returns the entered text as a string.

Here's an example usage of the `Console.ReadLine` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Enter your name: ");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
```

In the above example, the `Console.WriteLine` method is used to prompt the user to enter their name and then `Console.ReadLine` reads the input from the console. The entered text is stored in the `name` variable as a string.

The `Console.ReadLine` method is commonly used when you need to get user input in a console application.

### Console.ReadKey

The `Console.ReadKey` method is a built-in method in C# that is used to obtain the next character or function key pressed by the user. It allows you to read a single key from the standard input stream without waiting for the user to press the Enter key.

Here's an example usage of the `Console.ReadKey` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue...");
Console.ReadKey();
```

In the above example, the `Console.ReadKey` method is used to wait for the user to press any key before continuing with the program execution.

The `Console.ReadKey` method is commonly used when you need to pause the program and wait for user input without requiring the user to press the Enter key.

### List<T>
To use the `List` class from .NET, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace at the top of your file:
  ```csharp
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  ```

2. Declare a new instance of the `List` class, specifying the type of elements it will hold. For example, to create a list of integers:
  ```csharp
  List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
  ```

3. Add elements to the list using the `Add` method. For example:
  ```csharp
  numbers.Add(10);
  numbers.Add(20);
  numbers.Add(30);
  ```

4. Access elements in the list using the indexer (`[]`) or by iterating over the list. For example:
  ```csharp
  int firstNumber = numbers[0];
  foreach (int number in numbers)
  {
     Console.WriteLine(number);
  }
  ```

5. Remove elements from the list using the `Remove` method. For example:
  ```csharp
  numbers.Remove(20);
  ```

6. Check the number of elements in the list using the `Count` property. For example:
  ```csharp
  int count = numbers.Count;
  ```

7. Perform other operations on the list such as sorting, searching, or filtering using the various methods available in the `List` class.

Remember to replace `int` with the appropriate type for your use case. Happy coding!
